# tarot_project
tarot project for codecademy
This is an attempt at a rudimentary tarot reading program using the skills in Codecademy's Python lessons.  In this program, my goal is to create a field where the user can ask the program a question, and the program will in turn provide three tarot cards of the Major Arcana and provide the meanings in order to give the user a soft conclusion as to the answer of their question.

Given time, this program could include multiple different tarot spread patterns, as well as functionality to include reversed meanings of the Major Arcana, though that is not the intention of the initial build.

Update (8/11/2022):
Data has now been added for reversed Major Arcana readings.
