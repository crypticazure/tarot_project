The universe is calling on you to release the old mental models and behavioural patterns that no longer serve you so you can see your world from a new perspective and embrace new opportunities that would have otherwise been hidden from you if you didn’t hit the brakes"
MajArcana[13].ArcanaMeaning = "change, transformation, and transition. A major part of your life that is no longer serving you shall come to an end soon, opening up the possibility of something far more valuable and essential. You must close one door to open another"
MajArcana[14].ArcanaMeaning = "balance, patience, and moderation. Remain calm, even when life feels stressful or frantic. Include others and bring together diverse groups of people to create harmony and cooperation. By working together, you will collectively leverage the right mix of talents, experiences, abilities and skills"
MajArcana[15].ArcanaMeaning = "your darker side, and the negative forces that constrain you and hold you back from being the best version of yourself.

Shine your light on the negative patterns that have been standing in your way for so long, and over time, you will loosen the grip they have on you"
MajArcana[16].ArcanaMeaning = "sudden change, chaos, and revelation. Change is coming, whether you would like it or not. A sudden event may bring about chaos and destruction in its wake.

MajArcana[17].ArcanaMeaning = "hope, purpose, and renewal.

This reflection may also be what you need to bring your project to its final stages"
#beginning the reversed major arcana definitions
MajArcana[22].ArcanaMeaning = "holding back, recklessness, and risk-taking. This suggests that you have conceived of a new project but aren’t ready to ‘birth’ it into the world just yet. You may worry that you are not fit or that you don’t have all the tools, skills and resources you need to make this project a success. Something is holding you back, and you are preventing yourself from moving forward"
MajArcana[23].ArcanaMeaning = "manipulation, poor planning, and untapped talents. On one level, you are exploring what you wish to manifest, but are not taking the steps forward to achieve your goal.  You may worry that you do not have the right tools or resources you need. If you take care of what you intend to manifest, the Universe will work out the how. Stay attuned to your intuition and pay attention to opportunities as they arise"
MajArcana[24].ArcanaMeaning = "secrets, disconnect from intuition, and withdrawal. Be still and direct your attention inward to listen to your voice and wisdom. You may be swayed by other people’s opinions or swept up in their drama when what you really need to do is focus on what is right for you"
MajArcana[25].ArcanaMeaning = "creative block and dependence on others. Make self-love and self-care a priority. Now is the time to bring your loving energy and focus to yourself, especially if you have been giving away your personal power by placing too much emphasis on another person’s emotional or material needs, thus neglecting your own. You may also crave a stronger connection with nature and Mother Earth. Now is the perfect occasion to spend even just a few hours in a natural setting such as a beach, park or garden"
MajArcana[26].ArcanaMeaning = "excessive control, lack of discipline, and inflexibility. This can suggest an over-use and abuse of authoritative power surrounding you. It could originate from you or from another person, often a boss, partner or father figure. Seek to find a solution where you lead from a place of personal power and enable others to do the same. Power can be equally and constructively distributed – you don’t need to take it from others, nor do you need to give yours away"
MajArcana[27].ArcanaMeaning = "personal beliefs, freedom, and challenging the status quo. The Universe wishes to remind you that you are your own teacher. You are being guided to follow your own path and adopt your own spiritual belief systems rather than blindly following others’. It may feel unsettling at first as you make your own way, but over time, you will learn to trust yourself and tap into your inner knowledge"
MajArcana[28].ArcanaMeaning = "self-love, imbalance, and misalignment of values. This can signal a time when you’re out of sync with those around you, particularly your loved ones. You may find your relationships are strained and communication is challenging. Come back to the reason you have them in your life. If you love them unconditionally, know this moment shall pass and the best you can do is bring love and compassion to the situation. In other cases, you may realise that you have simply grown apart and it’s time to move on"
MajArcana[29].ArcanaMeaning = "self-discipline, opposition, and lack of direction. You might bang your head against a brick wall, trying to push a project forward when really, you ought to back off or change direction. Or you might have lost your motivation and no longer feel as committed to the outcome as you did when you started. This is a warning that you are letting obstacles and challenges get in the way, preventing you from achieving what you set out to do. It’s all getting too hard, and you don’t have the will to go on. If that resonates, stop for a moment and think about the things that matter most to you and why you want to achieve this goal"
MajArcana[30].ArcanaMeaning = "low energy, self-doubt, and raw emotion. Tune in to your current levels of inner strength, confidence and self-belief. If you have recently experienced a setback, you may be vulnerable and lacking in self-confidence.  Know that your core strength will always be with you and now is as good a time as any to reconnect with this power.  You may hold more strength and resilience than you give yourself credit for - so be kind to yourself."
MajArcana[31].ArcanaMeaning = "isolation, loneliness, and withdrawal. This can go one of two ways: either you ar enot taking enough time for personal reflection, or you are taking too much time. It is time to go deeper into your inner being and rediscover your greater purpose on this earth. You may have been so busy dealing with day-to-day issues that you have forgotten to listen to your inner voice. On the other hand, you may have been spending too much time reflecting on your inner self. This suggests that you may be taking this isolation thing too far. Do not underestimate the value of staying connected with others, even while you are going through your journey. Be mindful of other peoples' needs as well, though, as you do not want to become so absorbed in yourself and your personal dilemmas that you shut out your family and friends"
MajArcana[32].ArcanaMeaning = "bad luck, resistance to change, and breaking cycles. Your luck and fortune may take a turn for the worst. You may experience unexpected change or negative forces could be at play, leaving you helpless.  You can either do nothing and hope things will get better, or you can act to improve your situation. See this moment as an opportunity to take control of your destiny in order to get your life back on track. This could also suggest that change has become a source of significant stress, and you may be trying to consciously or subconsciously stop events from running their course. Accept that change is inevitable and you will have a much-improved experience"
MajArcana[33].ArcanaMeaning = "unfairness, lack of accountability, and dishonesty. Internally, you may know you've done something that isn't morally right. Others may not see it yet, so you have a choice: hide it and hope no one finds out, or own up to your mistakes and take focused action to resolve the situation. You are being dishonest with yourself and others, and your unwillingness to look beyond your own fears and ego blinds you to the broader lesson. Acknowledge where you made a mistake and do whatever you can to make it right. In doing so, you will free yourself from any guilt or shame and empower yourself to make better decisions."
MajArcana[34].ArcanaMeaning = "delays, resistance, and indecision. You need to pause and see things from a different perspective, even though you are resisting it. Your spirit and body are asking you to slow down, but your mind keeps racing. You must rest before it's too late, and you end up crashing. If your life has already been on pause for a period, this may come as a positive sign that you can now move forward with a new perspective and a renewed sense of energy"
MajArcana[35].ArcanaMeaning = "resistance to change, inner purging, and personal transformation. You are on the verge of meaningful change, but you are resisting it. Maybe you are reluctant to let go, or you may not know how to make the change you need. Because of your refusal, life has stagnated, and you feel stuck in limbo. As you learn to release the past and surrender to the present, the future becomes even brighter. Be sure to embrace change in all forms, and you may be surprised at how this subtle shift in energy allows new doors to open in ways you may never have expected"
MajArcana[36].ArcanaMeaning = "imbalance, excess, and self-healing. This is a sign to restore balance and moderation as soon as possible. Perhaps you have been doing something in excess. This activity will take you further away from who you are and what you are here to do. Remember, everything is fine in moderation. This can also be a sign that something is off in your life, creating stress and tension. You can ignore it and carry on with life as usual, but if you stay in this state for too long, that voice will just get louder and louder until you're forced to pay attention"
MajArcana[37].ArcanaMeaning = "exploring dark thoughts and detachment. This often appears when you are on the verge of a breakthrough. You are being called to your highest potential, but first ,you must let go of any unhealthy attachments or limiting beliefs that may hold you back. This calls on you to confront your inner fears and anxieties to free yourself from the chains that bind you to your limiting beliefs and unhealthy attachments"
MajArcana[38].ArcanaMeaning = "personal transformation, fear of change, and averting disaster. This suggests that you are undergoing a significant personal transformation and upheaval. This change is something you are instigating, and is calling into question your fundamental belief systems, values, purpose, and meaning. This can also be a sign that you're resisting change and delaying the necessary destruction and upheaval. You may be in denial that change is occurring, or you may be clinging to an old belief system even though you know it is no longer relevant or healthy for you"
MajArcana[39].ArcanaMeaning = "lack of faith, despair, and disconnection. This can mean that you have lost faith and hope in the Universe. You may feel overwhelmed by life's challeneges right now, and may be questioning why you are being put through this. Take a moment to ask yourself how your experiences could be a blessing, and not a punishment. This could be a sign that you are disengaged and uninspired with life or components of your life - such as work, hobbies, relationships, etc. Reconnect to what is truly important to you and your purpose for this lifetime"
MajArcana[40].ArcanaMeaning = "repressed emotion and inner confusion. This indicates that you have been dealing with fears and anxiety, and now the negative influences of these energies are subsiding. You may bury these feelings even deeper within your subconscious so you can avoid your dark shadows. You may not be ready to face your emotions, pushing them to the side and pretending as if nothing is wrong. This could work in the short term, but eventually you will need to resurface these emotions and deal with them head on"
MajArcana[41].ArcanaMeaning = "feeling down or overly optimistic. See this as your permission slip to leave behind your work and responsibilities, even for just a moment, and enjoy life. You could dance, sing, and let your heart be free. You may be struggling to see the bright side of life. You may have experienced setbacks that damaged your enthusiasm and optimism, and perhaps led you to question whether you cna achieve what you set out to do. Nonetheless, this is only temporary. Obstacles you see can easily be removed if you put your mind to it. It may just take a bit more effort than usual"
MajArcana[42].ArcanaMeaning = "self-doubt and your inner critic. This calls for a period of reflection and self-evaluation. You may arrive at a deep understanding of the universal themes weaving throughout your life and what you can do or change to avoid these situations. To clear these past mistakes and regrets, and any associated guilt or shame, you must work on self-forgiveness, self-love, and release. Maybe you're afraid of the sacrifice you'll need to make to achieve your goal, or you're worrie you are not ready to step into a more prominent role and just want to play it safe. It's time to push back your inner fears and self-doubt, and trust that the Universe has your back"
MajArcana[43].ArcanaMeaning = "shortcuts, delays, and seeking personal closure. Perhaps you are still emotionally attached to a past relationship and want to move on, or you dream of the person you once were. You know, deep down, that in order to accept and embrace where you are now, you need to let go of the past and move on. This can signify that you want to fulfill a big goal or complet e a big project, but you're not taking all the steps necessary to get there, opting for the easiest or quickest path to attain your goal. This will not lead to the outcome you intend. You need to experience the trials and tribulations along the way, so you can learn and grow."
#Minor Arcana reading data, starting from "Ace of Cups", going down to "King of Cups", then repeating for Swords, Pentacles, and Wands
MinArcana[0].ArcanaMeaning = "love, new relationships, compassion, and creativity. Now is the perfect time for you to open your heart and experience the rich flow of emotion available to you right now. This is an invitation to be open to creative expression, especially when you can allow your emotions to shine through your endeavours. You may be inspired to start a new project or learn something new. Let your imagination and talent unfurl to new possibilities"
MinArcana[1].ArcanaMeaning = "unified love, partnership, and mutual attraction. This shows you are creating deep connections and partnerships based on shared values, compassion, and unconditional love. While these relationships may still be in the early stages, they have the potential to grow and develop into something deeply fulfilling and rewarding in the long-term"
MinArcana[2].ArcanaMeaning = "celebration, friendship, creativity, and collaborations. Your family and friends are here to support you and lift you up to even higher levels of success. Celebrate with them and enjoy the camaraderie. You are being encouraged to gather with your closest friends and have a good time together: talking, laughing, sharing, and creating. Together, you give and receive the love, support, and compassion each of you needs from one another. This often indicates a very sociable period, perhaps a birthday or holiday. Instead of worrying about your day-to-day commitments and obligations, try to spend quality time with your feidns and family and enjoy yourself"
MinArcana[3].ArcanaMeaning = "meditation, contemplation, apathy, and reevaluation. This shows that new invitations and opportunities are flowing to you, but for now, you're turning them away. Perhaps the prospects do not interest you, or you already have too much on your plate? Use your discernment to decide on what is truly important to you, and don't be afraid to decline new projects that don't align with your future path. While you may need to decline some very alluring opportunities, you do so in knowing you will be in a better position to say \"yes\" to the opportunities that are a better fit for you. This may also mean that you are bored or dissatisfied with your everyday life. You may feel disengaged, apathetic, or unmotivated. This invites you to bring your attention inward and reevaluate your situation to find a deeper meaning in what you do"
MinArcana[4].ArcanaMeaning = "regret, failure, disappointment, and pessimism. This often appears when a situation hasn't turned out the way you expected, leaving you feeling sad, regretful, and disappointed. Instead of moving on, you are choosing to wallow in self-pity. You may blame yourself or believe you're a victim of life's circumstances. You must release these negative emotions so that you can move on and create positive change in your life"
MinArcana[5].ArcanaMeaning = "revisiting the past, childhood memories, innocence, and joy. You may simply be revisiting these childhood memories in your mind, or you may travel back to your childhoom home or reconnect with your childhood friends. These connections can bring you a sense of joy and happiness as you reminisce over all the fun times you had back then. This can show an increased level of harmony and cooperation in your relationships. You may be ready to give and receive, without expectation. This can invite you to get in touch with your inner child and experience the fun, freedom, and innocence that comes with being a young child again. When you give yourself permission to be playful, spontaneous, and creative, you connect more with your authentic self and your intuition"
MinArcana[6].ArcanaMeaning = "opportunities, choices, wishful thinking, and illusion. You may have many options and opportunities from which you can choose, but be careful! You are prone to unrealistic ideals and illusion. An opportunity with promises of more money or power may sound appealing, but as you look deeper into what is on offer, you may realize that it's not everything it's cracked up to be. This can be a sign of wishful thinking and projecting into the future about what you want to create, rather than taking action here in the present to make it happen. If you spend most of your time wishing but not doing the work, then it's time to choose just one thing and make it happen. This may be a sign of \"Shiny Object Syndrome\", where you keep finding the next big thing, but fail to see any of those new opportunities through to the end. When you are constantly in the idea phase, you miss the chance to bring your designs into fruition"
MinArcana[7].ArcanaMeaning = "disappointment, abandonment, withdrawal, and escapism. You may feel compelled to walk away from a disappointing situation. That could mean turning your back on an unfulfilling relationship, job, living arrangement, or creative project that was once a source of great happiness ot you but now only brings you pain. This situation hasn't turned out the way you had expected it to, and you realize that you are no longer getting anything out of this situation. Even if it brings you sadness, the only choice is to put it behind you and move on with your life. This might symbolize that you might be missing something, particularly on an emotional or spiritual level. Instead of waiting around for things to get better, you know that you need to leave that unfulfilling situation. This could also be a sign that you are already trying to escape this situation, or avoid some major psychological issues and concerns, refusing to deal with them. You may repress your emotions or refuse to have open conversations with others about what's happening, instead preferring to pretend as if everything is okay"
MinArcana[8].ArcanaMeaning = "contentment, satisfaction, and gratitude. This shows you are content in pretty much every aspect of your life: relationships, work, lifestyle, well-being, and more. This is often referred to as the Wish Card, as it comes as a sign that the planets have aligned and you have everything you wished for, and could not be happier. If you have made your wish and are patiently waiting for it to come to fruition, then this card is an excellent omen that it will soon be granted. This is an invitation to indulge and enjoy life's pleasures. Appreciate the arts and live in the moment. Give yourself permission to indulge without any guilt about possible negative consequences"
MinArcana[9].ArcanaMeaning = "blissful relationsips, harmony, and alignment. You have created an abundance of love and happiness in your life, and now you share this love with others, expanding your heart even more. This often appears when you are surrounded by your loved ones with whom you share a powerful and deep connection. This suggests that your familial relationships are harmonious and loving right now, and you are in a place where you can spend more time with your family and create happy memories. This may also indicate a new and blissful relationship or a long-term commitment with another"
MinArcana[10].ArcanaMeaning = "creative opportunities, intuitive messages, curiosity, and possibility. This suggests a new idea or opportunity has come to you out of the blue. Your creative energy is flowing, and now you are wondering how you will express it. This invites you to have an open and curious mind, as it is with a curious mind that you will discover new aspects of life and yourself. Embrace your inner child and believe that anything is possible"
MinArcana[11].ArcanaMeaning = "creativity, romance, charm, imagination, and beauty. This shows that you thrive on all things beautiful and are inspired by the many creative outlets available to you. You have dreamed about what it is you want to create and are now moving forward with this dream to make it a reality. Be open to exploring your passions and your big ideas, as you may find yourself drawn to a particular passion or hobby, and now is the time to turn it into something extraordinary. While you are in no hurry to reach the finish line, keep in mind that true imagination feeds on action. If you do nothing with your dreams, they will remain just that: dreams"
MinArcana[12].ArcanaMeaning = "compassion, caring, and intuition. You are embodying the Queen's nurturing mother energy. You support others by listening with your heart, being compassionate, and caring for them deeply, and you hold the space for others to express their emotions and be the truest, most authentic versions of themselves. You are highly intuitive, creative, and in flow with the surrounding energies. You are being asked to trust your intuition and pay attention to your feelings and emotions. Lead with your heart, not your head. Be open to receiving the intuitive messages flowing to you, be it through your dreams, meditation, or visualization"
MinArcana[13].ArcanaMeaning = "emotional balance and diplomacy. This suggests you have gained control of your feelings and can accept them without allowing them to get the better of you. Even when life throws you a curve ball, you can draw on your emotional maturity and stability to help you navigate these challenges. If you are being challenged personally, this suggests you need to remain emotionally mature when faced with negative energy from others. Be firm on your personal boundaries, stating what is and isn't acceptable on an emotional level"
#beginning the Swords definitions
MinArcana[14].ArcanaMeaning = "breakthroughs, new ideas, and success. See this as a sign of encouragement. You may be on the verge of a significant breakthrough or a new way of thinking that allows you to view the world with clear eyes. You are open to embracing new ideas, craving stimulation, and you'll jump at the next opportunity to learn something new. You thrive on new ideas, inspiration, original thinking, and vision. This is now an excellent time to start a new project - one that requires your intellect, communication skills, and mental power"
MinArcana[15].ArcanaMeaning = "difficult decisions, weighing options, an impasse, and avoidance. This indicates that you are facing a challenging decision, but you are unclear about which option to take. Both possibilities may seem equally good - or equally bad - and you are stumped about which will lead you to the best outcome. Use both your head and your heart to choose the path that is most beneficial to you. You may lack the information you need to make the right decisions, such as the potential risks or threats, or alternative solutions or other critical pieces of information that would help guide you in a particular direction. Be sure to research your options more, seek outside opinions and feedback, and ask yourself what you might be missing"
MinArcana[16].ArcanaMeaning = "heartbreak, emotional pain, sorrow, grief, and hurt. This signals that you are feeling deeply hurt and disappointed. You have been hurt by others' words, actions, and intentions, and they have inflicted intense emotions of pain, sadness, grief, and heartbreak. This also comes as an emotional release. Now is an excellent time to have a good cry, as expressing your sadness is part of the cleansing process. Allow yourself the opportunity to experience these emotions, no matter how painful"
MinArcana[17].ArcanaMeaning = "rest, relaxation, meditation, contemplation, and recuperation. You have reached an important first milestone and must recharge your energy before the next phase begins, so you are refreshed and ready to go. Even if you have been highly productive and driven, you must take time out from your schedule to restore your energy and heal the body and mind. If you have been going through tough times recently, then this comes as a sign to take a step back and gain perspective. Perhaps you should take a day off work, or spend time with your loved ones - whatever you need to take a break. Now is not the time to make decisions"
MinArcana[18].ArcanaMeaning = "conflict, disagreements, competition, and defeat. You may have had a falling out or a conflict, and are walking away with a sense of sadness and loss. Even if you came out the apparent victor, you realize that you have lost as much as (or more than) your opponent. The advice here is to pick your battles. You may be tempted to fight every conflict to ensure you get your way, to prove that you're right, or to defend yourself when you are feeling challenged or threatened; however, choosing your battles wisely is a much better way of life than engaging in every disagreement"
MinArcana[19].ArcanaMeaning = "transition, change, and releasing baggage. This shows you are leaving behind what was familiar and moving towards the unknown. This invites you to let go of whatever is holding you back, be it from your past or present circumstances. Instead, gaze ahead to your future and choose the way most in alignment with your values. You will need to make tough decisions and compromises along the way, but you can see it as a rite of passage. This asks you to reflect on any emotional or mental baggage you may carry as you move from one phase to the next. You may still be carrying a heavy weight from your past as you move forward, and you must decide what you need to take with you, and what you can stand to leave behind"
MinArcana[20].ArcanaMeaning = "betrayal, deception, and acting strategically. You may be trying to get away with something and are sneaking around other peoples' backs, hoping to go undetected. Be aware that any time you use cunning or deception to gain an advantage over someone or something else, you are at risk of being found out. Alternatively, you may be the victim of someone else's betrayal. Others may not be candid with you, and you may be unaware of their lies and deception. Listen to your intuition when something doesn't feel right or seems too good to be true. On a more positive note, this indicates that you need to be strategic in what you do. You must prioritize what is important to you and direct your focus and attention on the few tasks that will move you closer to your goals"
MinArcana[21].ArcanaMeaning = "negative thoughts, imprisonment, victim mentality, and self-imposed restriction. You may feel trapped and restricted by your circumstances, believing that your options are limited with no clear path out. This comes as a warning that your thoughts and beliefs are no longer serving you. YOu may be overthinking things, creating negative patterns, or limiting yourself by only considering the worst-case scenario. It is time to get out of your head and let go of those thoughts and beliefs holding you back. This assures you that there is a way out of your current predicament, you just need a new perspective. You already have the resources you need, but it is up to you to use those resources in a way that serves you. Others may offer to help, or there may be an alternative solution you haven't yet fully explored. Just try to be open to finding the answer, rather than getting stuck on the problem"
MinArcana[22].ArcanaMeaning = "anxiety, worry, fear, depression, and nightmares. This suggests that dark thoughts and disturbing feelings are weighing you down. You may be worrying excessively about a situation, and your negative thoughts are getting the better of you. Be careful, because the fear and worry that this card can symbolize may become a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is here to remind you that much of the fear and worry you are experiencing is in your head, and not necessarily an accurate reflection of what is happening around you. It is time to examine your situation from a new perspective. Instead of looking for evidence of what is going wrong, put your attention on what is going right. Take a deep breath and realize that life is not as dreadful as it seems, and that the more you worry, the more harm you are doing to yourself"
MinArcana[23].ArcanaMeaning = "painful endings, deep wounds, betrayal, loss, and crisis. This marks a painful yet inevitable ending. You may be the victim of another person's betrayal or deceit, as if you have been stabbed in the back and are reeling from someone else's actions. This can suggest taht you are taking on the role of \"The Victim\", hoping others will pity you and save you from despair. You cannot change the actions of another person, but you can change how you respond. You have a choice to either pick yourself up and move forward with your life, or fall down in a heap, hoping someone will take pity on you"
MinArcana[24].ArcanaMeaning = "new ideas, curiosity, thirst for knowledge, and new ways of communicating. This often means you are exploring a new way of thinking - a new idea, perspective, knowledge, or a new technique. This can also suggest that you are exploring a different way of expressing yourself with others, and communicating your ideas and opinions. This is the exploratory phase, so be open to new ways of expressing yourself and discovering where your inner talents lie"
MinArcana[25].ArcanaMeaning = "ambition, fast thinking, and drive to succeed. This might be a sign that you are quick to take action and tend not to plan ahead, instead preferring to dive right in. You thrive on high levels of energy that propel you forward and inspire you to take action to manifest your goals. This will remind you to be assertive in getting what you want. Do not hang back and wait for something to happen. Try to be proactive and forward-thinking. The downside to this, however, can be that you act too quickly. You may have not thoroughly thought things through. You may be unaware of potential challenges and issues that will stand in your way, or the unintended consequences of your actions"
MinArcana[26].ArcanaMeaning = "independence, unbiased judgement, and direct communication. This can mean that you are a truth seeker. You may be open to hearing the thoughts and opinions of others, but ultimately, you filter that information to decipher what is true and what is not. This may suggest that you have an innate ability to \"tell it like it is\". You are upfront and honest in your views, and you expect the same from others."
MinArcana[27].ArcanaMeaning = "mental clarity, intellectual power, authority, and truth. This can indicate that you have a clarity of mind and can perceive the truth, so it is up to you to take the lead with providing an objective point of view and making decisions based on impartial judgement. While you may worry that you are not being particularly caring or sympathetic with others, this detachment is what you need most right now. This encourages you to use your logic and intellect to navigate the path ahead. You need to be able to take any situation, look at it with total impartiality, and then come to a balanced and insightful decision"
#start of Pentacles definitions
MinArcana[28].ArcanaMeaning = "manifestation, abundance, and new opportunities. You can see this as your green light. It marks the initial stages of manifessting your goals and assures you that you can truly achieve what you have set your mind to do. Your ideas are ready to turn into something tangible and real. This encourages you to map out how you will achieve your ambitions, create targeted plans, and get those actions underway"
MinArcana[29].ArcanaMeaning = "multiple priorities, time management, prioritization, and adaptability. This can signify that you are juggling your priorities, roles and responsibilities. This notes that you are doing an excellent job of balancing these different priorities, and you can take on whatever life throws at you; but this also is here to remind you that the line between coping with these demands and losing control is thin. This often appears when you are busy, rushing from one thing to the next, with little downtime in between. Sometimes taking a break is the most productive thing you can do. This invites you to manage your time and your priorities carefully"
MinArcana[30].ArcanaMeaning = "teamwork, collaboration, learning, and implementation. As you work on projects with others, acknowledge the value that each person brings to the table. You will also learn from each member of the team when you see their own unique contribution. This can mark the initial stages of implementation that can follow the idea and planning phases. You know what you want to create. You've laid out the plans, gathered your resources, and set to work. As you implement your plans, you will realize that you have the skills, capabilities, and resources you need to accomplish your objectives. See this as encouragement that you are on the right track, and that you are competent at what you do"
MinArcana[31].ArcanaMeaning = "saving money, security, conservatism, scarcity, and control. This is asking you to examine your relationship with money. In its most positive state, this can suggest that you have created wealth and abundance by maintaining a steady focus on your goals and acting conservatively; however, this typically accompanies a scarcity mindset, especially with money and material possessions. Instead of spending your money and enjoying a comfortable lifestyle, you are choosing to stockpile your finances, for fear you might lose it all or someone else might take it away. Your budget may be so conservative or strict that it cuts out many of life's pleasures - including travel, social occasions, gifts, or fun activities. Remember, money works best when it can flow and exchange, not when it is being stashed away"
MinArcana[32].ArcanaMeaning = "financial loss, poverty, isolation, and worry. You may have hit hard times, especially when it comes to work, finances, and material possessions. In this time of need, you may feel isolated and alone. It may appear as if no one cares; however, know that help is nearby, even though you may be too focused on your problems to notice. You may be waiting for someone to come and help you, when really, you need to be proactive and ask for help"
MinArcana[33].ArcanaMeaning = "giving, receiving, generosity, and charity. You may be inclined to make a loan to someone on the premise that they will eventually pay you back once they're capable of doing so. This is a loan built on trust and good faith, knowing that if you give something away, it will come back to you. Remember, though, that this exchange is more about a short-term fix and not a sustainable solution. On the other hand, you may be on the receiving end of other peoples' generosity, accepting these gifts with gratitude. This will help you get back on your feet, and to eventually repay the charitable organization or individual. You will also need to identify ways in which you can become more self-sufficient in the long run, as the risk of accepting charity is that you become dependend on it and cannot look after yourself"
