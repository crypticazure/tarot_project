The universe is calling on you to release the old mental models and behavioural patterns that no longer serve you so you can see your world from a new perspective and embrace new opportunities that would have otherwise been hidden from you if you didn’t hit the brakes"
MajArcana[13].ArcanaMeaning = "change, transformation, and transition. A major part of your life that is no longer serving you shall come to an end soon, opening up the possibility of something far more valuable and essential. You must close one door to open another"
MajArcana[14].ArcanaMeaning = "balance, patience, and moderation. Remain calm, even when life feels stressful or frantic. Include others and bring together diverse groups of people to create harmony and cooperation. By working together, you will collectively leverage the right mix of talents, experiences, abilities and skills"
MajArcana[15].ArcanaMeaning = "your darker side, and the negative forces that constrain you and hold you back from being the best version of yourself.

Shine your light on the negative patterns that have been standing in your way for so long, and over time, you will loosen the grip they have on you"
MajArcana[16].ArcanaMeaning = "sudden change, chaos, and revelation. Change is coming, whether you would like it or not. A sudden event may bring about chaos and destruction in its wake.

MajArcana[17].ArcanaMeaning = "hope, purpose, and renewal.

Look back at your past experiences and acknowledge how far you have come and what you learned along the way. It may surprise you to look back at your progress and see how much you achieved. This reflection may also be what you need to bring your project to its final stages"
#beginning the reversed major arcana definitions
MajArcana[22].ArcanaMeaning = "holding back, recklessness, and risk-taking. This suggests that you have conceived of a new project but aren’t ready to ‘birth’ it into the world just yet. You may worry that you are not fit or that you don’t have all the tools, skills and resources you need to make this project a success. Something is holding you back, and you are preventing yourself from moving forward"
MajArcana[23].ArcanaMeaning = "manipulation, poor planning, and untapped talents. On one level, you are exploring what you wish to manifest, but are not taking the steps forward to achieve your goal.  You may worry that you do not have the right tools or resources you need. If you take care of what you intend to manifest, the Universe will work out the how. Stay attuned to your intuition and pay attention to opportunities as they arise"
MajArcana[24].ArcanaMeaning = "secrets, disconnect from intuition, and withdrawal. Be still and direct your attention inward to listen to your voice and wisdom. You may be swayed by other people’s opinions or swept up in their drama when what you really need to do is focus on what is right for you"
MajArcana[25].ArcanaMeaning = "creative block and dependence on others. Make self-love and self-care a priority. Now is the time to bring your loving energy and focus to yourself, especially if you have been giving away your personal power by placing too much emphasis on another person’s emotional or material needs, thus neglecting your own. You may also crave a stronger connection with nature and Mother Earth. Now is the perfect occasion to spend even just a few hours in a natural setting such as a beach, park or garden"
MajArcana[26].ArcanaMeaning = "excessive control, lack of discipline, and inflexibility. This can suggest an over-use and abuse of authoritative power surrounding you. It could originate from you or from another person, often a boss, partner or father figure. Seek to find a solution where you lead from a place of personal power and enable others to do the same. Power can be equally and constructively distributed – you don’t need to take it from others, nor do you need to give yours away"
MajArcana[27].ArcanaMeaning = "personal beliefs, freedom, and challenging the status quo. The Universe wishes to remind you that you are your own teacher. You are being guided to follow your own path and adopt your own spiritual belief systems rather than blindly following others’. It may feel unsettling at first as you make your own way, but over time, you will learn to trust yourself and tap into your inner knowledge"
MajArcana[28].ArcanaMeaning = "self-love, imbalance, and misalignment of values. This can signal a time when you’re out of sync with those around you, particularly your loved ones. You may find your relationships are strained and communication is challenging. Come back to the reason you have them in your life. If you love them unconditionally, know this moment shall pass and the best you can do is bring love and compassion to the situation. In other cases, you may realise that you have simply grown apart and it’s time to move on"
MajArcana[29].ArcanaMeaning = "self-discipline, opposition, and lack of direction. You might bang your head against a brick wall, trying to push a project forward when really, you ought to back off or change direction. Or you might have lost your motivation and no longer feel as committed to the outcome as you did when you started. This is a warning that you are letting obstacles and challenges get in the way, preventing you from achieving what you set out to do. It’s all getting too hard, and you don’t have the will to go on. If that resonates, stop for a moment and think about the things that matter most to you and why you want to achieve this goal"
MajArcana[30].ArcanaMeaning = "low energy, self-doubt, and raw emotion. Tune in to your current levels of inner strength, confidence and self-belief. If you have recently experienced a setback, you may be vulnerable and lacking in self-confidence.  Know that your core strength will always be with you and now is as good a time as any to reconnect with this power.  You may hold more strength and resilience than you give yourself credit for - so be kind to yourself."
MajArcana[31].ArcanaMeaning = "isolation, loneliness, and withdrawal. This can go one of two ways: either you ar enot taking enough time for personal reflection, or you are taking too much time. It is time to go deeper into your inner being and rediscover your greater purpose on this earth. You may have been so busy dealing with day-to-day issues that you have forgotten to listen to your inner voice. On the other hand, you may have been spending too much time reflecting on your inner self. This suggests that you may be taking this isolation thing too far. Do not underestimate the value of staying connected with others, even while you are going through your journey. Be mindful of other peoples' needs as well, though, as you do not want to become so absorbed in yourself and your personal dilemmas that you shut out your family and friends"
MajArcana[32].ArcanaMeaning = "bad luck, resistance to change, and breaking cycles. Your luck and fortune may take a turn for the worst. You may experience unexpected change or negative forces could be at play, leaving you helpless.  You can either do nothing and hope things will get better, or you can act to improve your situation. See this moment as an opportunity to take control of your destiny in order to get your life back on track. This could also suggest that change has become a source of significant stress, and you may be trying to consciously or subconsciously stop events from running their course. Accept that change is inevitable and you will have a much-improved experience"
MajArcana[33].ArcanaMeaning = "unfairness, lack of accountability, and dishonesty. Internally, you may know you've done something that isn't morally right. Others may not see it yet, so you have a choice: hide it and hope no one finds out, or own up to your mistakes and take focused action to resolve the situation. You are being dishonest with yourself and others, and your unwillingness to look beyond your own fears and ego blinds you to the broader lesson. Acknowledge where you made a mistake and do whatever you can to make it right. In doing so, you will free yourself from any guilt or shame and empower yourself to make better decisions."
MajArcana[34].ArcanaMeaning = "delays, resistance, and indecision. You need to pause and see things from a different perspective, even though you are resisting it. Your spirit and body are asking you to slow down, but your mind keeps racing. You must rest before it's too late, and you end up crashing. If your life has already been on pause for a period, this may come as a positive sign that you can now move forward with a new perspective and a renewed sense of energy"
MajArcana[35].ArcanaMeaning = "resistance to change, inner purging, and personal transformation. You are on the verge of meaningful change, but you are resisting it. Maybe you are reluctant to let go, or you may not know how to make the change you need. Because of your refusal, life has stagnated, and you feel stuck in limbo. As you learn to release the past and surrender to the present, the future becomes even brighter. Be sure to embrace change in all forms, and you may be surprised at how this subtle shift in energy allows new doors to open in ways you may never have expected"
MajArcana[36].ArcanaMeaning = "imbalance, excess, and self-healing. This is a sign to restore balance and moderation as soon as possible. Perhaps you have been doing something in excess. This activity will take you further away from who you are and what you are here to do. Remember, everything is fine in moderation. This can also be a sign that something is off in your life, creating stress and tension. You can ignore it and carry on with life as usual, but if you stay in this state for too long, that voice will just get louder and louder until you're forced to pay attention"
MajArcana[37].ArcanaMeaning = "exploring dark thoughts and detachment. This often appears when you are on the verge of a breakthrough. You are being called to your highest potential, but first ,you must let go of any unhealthy attachments or limiting beliefs that may hold you back. This calls on you to confront your inner fears and anxieties to free yourself from the chains that bind you to your limiting beliefs and unhealthy attachments"
MajArcana[38].ArcanaMeaning = "personal transformation, fear of change, and averting disaster. This suggests that you are undergoing a significant personal transformation and upheaval. This change is something you are instigating, and is calling into question your fundamental belief systems, values, purpose, and meaning. This can also be a sign that you're resisting change and delaying the necessary destruction and upheaval. You may be in denial that change is occurring, or you may be clinging to an old belief system even though you know it is no longer relevant or healthy for you"
MajArcana[39].ArcanaMeaning = "lack of faith, despair, and disconnection. This can mean that you have lost faith and hope in the Universe. You may feel overwhelmed by life's challeneges right now, and may be questioning why you are being put through this. Take a moment to ask yourself how your experiences could be a blessing, and not a punishment. This could be a sign that you are disengaged and uninspired with life or components of your life - such as work, hobbies, relationships, etc. Reconnect to what is truly important to you and your purpose for this lifetime"
MajArcana[40].ArcanaMeaning = "repressed emotion and inner confusion. This indicates that you have been dealing with fears and anxiety, and now the negative influences of these energies are subsiding. You may bury these feelings even deeper within your subconscious so you can avoid your dark shadows. You may not be ready to face your emotions, pushing them to the side and pretending as if nothing is wrong. This could work in the short term, but eventually you will need to resurface these emotions and deal with them head on"
MajArcana[41].ArcanaMeaning = "feeling down or overly optimistic. See this as your permission slip to leave behind your work and responsibilities, even for just a moment, and enjoy life. You could dance, sing, and let your heart be free. You may be struggling to see the bright side of life. You may have experienced setbacks that damaged your enthusiasm and optimism, and perhaps led you to question whether you cna achieve what you set out to do. Nonetheless, this is only temporary. Obstacles you see can easily be removed if you put your mind to it. It may just take a bit more effort than usual"
MajArcana[42].ArcanaMeaning = "self-doubt and your inner critic. This calls for a period of reflection and self-evaluation. You may arrive at a deep understanding of the universal themes weaving throughout your life and what you can do or change to avoid these situations. To clear these past mistakes and regrets, and any associated guilt or shame, you must work on self-forgiveness, self-love, and release. Maybe you're afraid of the sacrifice you'll need to make to achieve your goal, or you're worrie you are not ready to step into a more prominent role and just want to play it safe. It's time to push back your inner fears and self-doubt, and trust that the Universe has your back"
MajArcana[43].ArcanaMeaning = "shortcuts, delays, and seeking personal closure. Perhaps you are still emotionally attached to a past relationship and want to move on, or you dream of the person you once were. You know, deep down, that in order to accept and embrace where you are now, you need to let go of the past and move on. This can signify that you want to fulfill a big goal or complet e a big project, but you're not taking all the steps necessary to get there, opting for the easiest or quickest path to attain your goal. This will not lead to the outcome you intend. You need to experience the trials and tribulations along the way, so you can learn and grow."
#Minor Arcana reading data, starting from "Ace of Cups", going down to "King of Cups", then repeating for Swords, Pentacles, and Wands
MinArcana[0].ArcanaMeaning = "love, new relationships, compassion, and creativity. Now is the perfect time for you to open your heart and experience the rich flow of emotion available to you right now. This is an invitation to be open to creative expression, especially when you can allow your emotions to shine through your endeavours. You may be inspired to start a new project or learn something new. Let your imagination and talent unfurl to new possibilities"
MinArcana[1].ArcanaMeaning = "unified love, partnership, and mutual attraction. This shows you are creating deep connections and partnerships based on shared values, compassion, and unconditional love. While these relationships may still be in the early stages, they have the potential to grow and develop into something deeply fulfilling and rewarding in the long-term"
MinArcana[2].ArcanaMeaning = "celebration, friendship, creativity, and collaborations. Your family and friends are here to support you and lift you up to even higher levels of success. Celebrate with them and enjoy the camaraderie. You are being encouraged to gather with your closest friends and have a good time together: talking, laughing, sharing, and creating. Together, you give and receive the love, support, and compassion each of you needs from one another. This often indicates a very sociable period, perhaps a birthday or holiday. Instead of worrying about your day-to-day commitments and obligations, try to spend quality time with your feidns and family and enjoy yourself"
MinArcana[3].ArcanaMeaning = "meditation, contemplation, apathy, and reevaluation. This shows that new invitations and opportunities are flowing to you, but for now, you're turning them away. Perhaps the prospects do not interest you, or you already have too much on your plate? Use your discernment to decide on what is truly important to you, and don't be afraid to decline new projects that don't align with your future path. While you may need to decline some very alluring opportunities, you do so in knowing you will be in a better position to say \"yes\" to the opportunities that are a better fit for you. This may also mean that you are bored or dissatisfied with your everyday life. You may feel disengaged, apathetic, or unmotivated. This invites you to bring your attention inward and reevaluate your situation to find a deeper meaning in what you do"
MinArcana[4].ArcanaMeaning = "regret, failure, disappointment, and pessimism. This often appears when a situation hasn't turned out the way you expected, leaving you feeling sad, regretful, and disappointed. Instead of moving on, you are choosing to wallow in self-pity. You may blame yourself or believe you're a victim of life's circumstances. You must release these negative emotions so that you can move on and create positive change in your life"
MinArcana[5].ArcanaMeaning = "revisiting the past, childhood memories, innocence, and joy. You may simply be revisiting these childhood memories in your mind, or you may travel back to your childhoom home or reconnect with your childhood friends. These connections can bring you a sense of joy and happiness as you reminisce over all the fun times you had back then. This can show an increased level of harmony and cooperation in your relationships. You may be ready to give and receive, without expectation. This can invite you to get in touch with your inner child and experience the fun, freedom, and innocence that comes with being a young child again. When you give yourself permission to be playful, spontaneous, and creative, you connect more with your authentic self and your intuition"
MinArcana[6].ArcanaMeaning = "opportunities, choices, wishful thinking, and illusion. You may have many options and opportunities from which you can choose, but be careful! You are prone to unrealistic ideals and illusion. An opportunity with promises of more money or power may sound appealing, but as you look deeper into what is on offer, you may realize that it's not everything it's cracked up to be. This can be a sign of wishful thinking and projecting into the future about what you want to create, rather than taking action here in the present to make it happen. If you spend most of your time wishing but not doing the work, then it's time to choose just one thing and make it happen. This may be a sign of \"Shiny Object Syndrome\", where you keep finding the next big thing, but fail to see any of those new opportunities through to the end. When you are constantly in the idea phase, you miss the chance to bring your designs into fruition"
MinArcana[7].ArcanaMeaning = "disappointment, abandonment, withdrawal, and escapism. You may feel compelled to walk away from a disappointing situation. That could mean turning your back on an unfulfilling relationship, job, living arrangement, or creative project that was once a source of great happiness ot you but now only brings you pain. This situation hasn't turned out the way you had expected it to, and you realize that you are no longer getting anything out of this situation. Even if it brings you sadness, the only choice is to put it behind you and move on with your life. This might symbolize that you might be missing something, particularly on an emotional or spiritual level. Instead of waiting around for things to get better, you know that you need to leave that unfulfilling situation. This could also be a sign that you are already trying to escape this situation, or avoid some major psychological issues and concerns, refusing to deal with them. You may repress your emotions or refuse to have open conversations with others about what's happening, instead preferring to pretend as if everything is okay"
MinArcana[8].ArcanaMeaning = "contentment, satisfaction, and gratitude. This shows you are content in pretty much every aspect of your life: relationships, work, lifestyle, well-being, and more. This is often referred to as the Wish Card, as it comes as a sign that the planets have aligned and you have everything you wished for, and could not be happier. If you have made your wish and are patiently waiting for it to come to fruition, then this card is an excellent omen that it will soon be granted. This is an invitation to indulge and enjoy life's pleasures. Appreciate the arts and live in the moment. Give yourself permission to indulge without any guilt about possible negative consequences"
MinArcana[9].ArcanaMeaning = "blissful relationsips, harmony, and alignment. You have created an abundance of love and happiness in your life, and now you share this love with others, expanding your heart even more. This often appears when you are surrounded by your loved ones with whom you share a powerful and deep connection. This suggests that your familial relationships are harmonious and loving right now, and you are in a place where you can spend more time with your family and create happy memories. This may also indicate a new and blissful relationship or a long-term commitment with another"
MinArcana[10].ArcanaMeaning = "creative opportunities, intuitive messages, curiosity, and possibility. This suggests a new idea or opportunity has come to you out of the blue. Your creative energy is flowing, and now you are wondering how you will express it. This invites you to have an open and curious mind, as it is with a curious mind that you will discover new aspects of life and yourself. Embrace your inner child and believe that anything is possible"
MinArcana[11].ArcanaMeaning = "creativity, romance, charm, imagination, and beauty. This shows that you thrive on all things beautiful and are inspired by the many creative outlets available to you. You have dreamed about what it is you want to create and are now moving forward with this dream to make it a reality. Be open to exploring your passions and your big ideas, as you may find yourself drawn to a particular passion or hobby, and now is the time to turn it into something extraordinary. While you are in no hurry to reach the finish line, keep in mind that true imagination feeds on action. If you do nothing with your dreams, they will remain just that: dreams"
MinArcana[12].ArcanaMeaning = "compassion, caring, and intuition. You are embodying the Queen's nurturing mother energy. You support others by listening with your heart, being compassionate, and caring for them deeply, and you hold the space for others to express their emotions and be the truest, most authentic versions of themselves. You are highly intuitive, creative, and in flow with the surrounding energies. You are being asked to trust your intuition and pay attention to your feelings and emotions. Lead with your heart, not your head. Be open to receiving the intuitive messages flowing to you, be it through your dreams, meditation, or visualization"
MinArcana[13].ArcanaMeaning = "emotional balance and diplomacy. This suggests you have gained control of your feelings and can accept them without allowing them to get the better of you. Even when life throws you a curve ball, you can draw on your emotional maturity and stability to help you navigate these challenges. If you are being challenged personally, this suggests you need to remain emotionally mature when faced with negative energy from others. Be firm on your personal boundaries, stating what is and isn't acceptable on an emotional level"
#beginning the Swords definitions
MinArcana[14].ArcanaMeaning = "breakthroughs, new ideas, and success. See this as a sign of encouragement. You may be on the verge of a significant breakthrough or a new way of thinking that allows you to view the world with clear eyes. You are open to embracing new ideas, craving stimulation, and you'll jump at the next opportunity to learn something new. You thrive on new ideas, inspiration, original thinking, and vision. This is now an excellent time to start a new project - one that requires your intellect, communication skills, and mental power"
MinArcana[15].ArcanaMeaning = "difficult decisions, weighing options, an impasse, and avoidance. This indicates that you are facing a challenging decision, but you are unclear about which option to take. Both possibilities may seem equally good - or equally bad - and you are stumped about which will lead you to the best outcome. Use both your head and your heart to choose the path that is most beneficial to you. You may lack the information you need to make the right decisions, such as the potential risks or threats, or alternative solutions or other critical pieces of information that would help guide you in a particular direction. Be sure to research your options more, seek outside opinions and feedback, and ask yourself what you might be missing"
MinArcana[16].ArcanaMeaning = "heartbreak, emotional pain, sorrow, grief, and hurt. This signals that you are feeling deeply hurt and disappointed. You have been hurt by others' words, actions, and intentions, and they have inflicted intense emotions of pain, sadness, grief, and heartbreak. This also comes as an emotional release. Now is an excellent time to have a good cry, as expressing your sadness is part of the cleansing process. Allow yourself the opportunity to experience these emotions, no matter how painful"
MinArcana[17].ArcanaMeaning = "rest, relaxation, meditation, contemplation, and recuperation. You have reached an important first milestone and must recharge your energy before the next phase begins, so you are refreshed and ready to go. Even if you have been highly productive and driven, you must take time out from your schedule to restore your energy and heal the body and mind. If you have been going through tough times recently, then this comes as a sign to take a step back and gain perspective. Perhaps you should take a day off work, or spend time with your loved ones - whatever you need to take a break. Now is not the time to make decisions"
MinArcana[18].ArcanaMeaning = "conflict, disagreements, competition, and defeat. You may have had a falling out or a conflict, and are walking away with a sense of sadness and loss. Even if you came out the apparent victor, you realize that you have lost as much as (or more than) your opponent. The advice here is to pick your battles. You may be tempted to fight every conflict to ensure you get your way, to prove that you're right, or to defend yourself when you are feeling challenged or threatened; however, choosing your battles wisely is a much better way of life than engaging in every disagreement"
MinArcana[19].ArcanaMeaning = "transition, change, and releasing baggage. This shows you are leaving behind what was familiar and moving towards the unknown. This invites you to let go of whatever is holding you back, be it from your past or present circumstances. Instead, gaze ahead to your future and choose the way most in alignment with your values. You will need to make tough decisions and compromises along the way, but you can see it as a rite of passage. This asks you to reflect on any emotional or mental baggage you may carry as you move from one phase to the next. You may still be carrying a heavy weight from your past as you move forward, and you must decide what you need to take with you, and what you can stand to leave behind"
MinArcana[20].ArcanaMeaning = "betrayal, deception, and acting strategically. You may be trying to get away with something and are sneaking around other peoples' backs, hoping to go undetected. Be aware that any time you use cunning or deception to gain an advantage over someone or something else, you are at risk of being found out. Alternatively, you may be the victim of someone else's betrayal. Others may not be candid with you, and you may be unaware of their lies and deception. Listen to your intuition when something doesn't feel right or seems too good to be true. On a more positive note, this indicates that you need to be strategic in what you do. You must prioritize what is important to you and direct your focus and attention on the few tasks that will move you closer to your goals"
MinArcana[21].ArcanaMeaning = "negative thoughts, imprisonment, victim mentality, and self-imposed restriction. You may feel trapped and restricted by your circumstances, believing that your options are limited with no clear path out. This comes as a warning that your thoughts and beliefs are no longer serving you. YOu may be overthinking things, creating negative patterns, or limiting yourself by only considering the worst-case scenario. It is time to get out of your head and let go of those thoughts and beliefs holding you back. This assures you that there is a way out of your current predicament, you just need a new perspective. You already have the resources you need, but it is up to you to use those resources in a way that serves you. Others may offer to help, or there may be an alternative solution you haven't yet fully explored. Just try to be open to finding the answer, rather than getting stuck on the problem"
MinArcana[22].ArcanaMeaning = "anxiety, worry, fear, depression, and nightmares. This suggests that dark thoughts and disturbing feelings are weighing you down. You may be worrying excessively about a situation, and your negative thoughts are getting the better of you. Be careful, because the fear and worry that this card can symbolize may become a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is here to remind you that much of the fear and worry you are experiencing is in your head, and not necessarily an accurate reflection of what is happening around you. It is time to examine your situation from a new perspective. Instead of looking for evidence of what is going wrong, put your attention on what is going right. Take a deep breath and realize that life is not as dreadful as it seems, and that the more you worry, the more harm you are doing to yourself"
MinArcana[23].ArcanaMeaning = "painful endings, deep wounds, betrayal, loss, and crisis. This marks a painful yet inevitable ending. You may be the victim of another person's betrayal or deceit, as if you have been stabbed in the back and are reeling from someone else's actions. This can suggest taht you are taking on the role of \"The Victim\", hoping others will pity you and save you from despair. You cannot change the actions of another person, but you can change how you respond. You have a choice to either pick yourself up and move forward with your life, or fall down in a heap, hoping someone will take pity on you"
MinArcana[24].ArcanaMeaning = "new ideas, curiosity, thirst for knowledge, and new ways of communicating. This often means you are exploring a new way of thinking - a new idea, perspective, knowledge, or a new technique. This can also suggest that you are exploring a different way of expressing yourself with others, and communicating your ideas and opinions. This is the exploratory phase, so be open to new ways of expressing yourself and discovering where your inner talents lie"
MinArcana[25].ArcanaMeaning = "ambition, fast thinking, and drive to succeed. This might be a sign that you are quick to take action and tend not to plan ahead, instead preferring to dive right in. You thrive on high levels of energy that propel you forward and inspire you to take action to manifest your goals. This will remind you to be assertive in getting what you want. Do not hang back and wait for something to happen. Try to be proactive and forward-thinking. The downside to this, however, can be that you act too quickly. You may have not thoroughly thought things through. You may be unaware of potential challenges and issues that will stand in your way, or the unintended consequences of your actions"
MinArcana[26].ArcanaMeaning = "independence, unbiased judgement, and direct communication. This can mean that you are a truth seeker. You may be open to hearing the thoughts and opinions of others, but ultimately, you filter that information to decipher what is true and what is not. This may suggest that you have an innate ability to \"tell it like it is\". You are upfront and honest in your views, and you expect the same from others."
MinArcana[27].ArcanaMeaning = "mental clarity, intellectual power, authority, and truth. This can indicate that you have a clarity of mind and can perceive the truth, so it is up to you to take the lead with providing an objective point of view and making decisions based on impartial judgement. While you may worry that you are not being particularly caring or sympathetic with others, this detachment is what you need most right now. This encourages you to use your logic and intellect to navigate the path ahead. You need to be able to take any situation, look at it with total impartiality, and then come to a balanced and insightful decision"
#start of Pentacles definitions
MinArcana[28].ArcanaMeaning = "manifestation, abundance, and new opportunities. You can see this as your green light. It marks the initial stages of manifessting your goals and assures you that you can truly achieve what you have set your mind to do. Your ideas are ready to turn into something tangible and real. This encourages you to map out how you will achieve your ambitions, create targeted plans, and get those actions underway"
MinArcana[29].ArcanaMeaning = "multiple priorities, time management, prioritization, and adaptability. This can signify that you are juggling your priorities, roles and responsibilities. This notes that you are doing an excellent job of balancing these different priorities, and you can take on whatever life throws at you; but this also is here to remind you that the line between coping with these demands and losing control is thin. This often appears when you are busy, rushing from one thing to the next, with little downtime in between. Sometimes taking a break is the most productive thing you can do. This invites you to manage your time and your priorities carefully"
MinArcana[30].ArcanaMeaning = "teamwork, collaboration, learning, and implementation. As you work on projects with others, acknowledge the value that each person brings to the table. You will also learn from each member of the team when you see their own unique contribution. This can mark the initial stages of implementation that can follow the idea and planning phases. You know what you want to create. You've laid out the plans, gathered your resources, and set to work. As you implement your plans, you will realize that you have the skills, capabilities, and resources you need to accomplish your objectives. See this as encouragement that you are on the right track, and that you are competent at what you do"
MinArcana[31].ArcanaMeaning = "saving money, security, conservatism, scarcity, and control. This is asking you to examine your relationship with money. In its most positive state, this can suggest that you have created wealth and abundance by maintaining a steady focus on your goals and acting conservatively; however, this typically accompanies a scarcity mindset, especially with money and material possessions. Instead of spending your money and enjoying a comfortable lifestyle, you are choosing to stockpile your finances, for fear you might lose it all or someone else might take it away. Your budget may be so conservative or strict that it cuts out many of life's pleasures - including travel, social occasions, gifts, or fun activities. Remember, money works best when it can flow and exchange, not when it is being stashed away"
MinArcana[32].ArcanaMeaning = "financial loss, poverty, isolation, and worry. You may have hit hard times, especially when it comes to work, finances, and material possessions. In this time of need, you may feel isolated and alone. It may appear as if no one cares; however, know that help is nearby, even though you may be too focused on your problems to notice. You may be waiting for someone to come and help you, when really, you need to be proactive and ask for help"
MinArcana[33].ArcanaMeaning = "giving, receiving, generosity, and charity. You may be inclined to make a loan to someone on the premise that they will eventually pay you back once they're capable of doing so. This is a loan built on trust and good faith, knowing that if you give something away, it will come back to you. Remember, though, that this exchange is more about a short-term fix and not a sustainable solution. On the other hand, you may be on the receiving end of other peoples' generosity, accepting these gifts with gratitude. This will help you get back on your feet, and to eventually repay the charitable organization or individual. You will also need to identify ways in which you can become more self-sufficient in the long run, as the risk of accepting charity is that you become dependend on it and cannot look after yourself"
MinArcana[34].ArcanaMeaning = "sustainable results, perseverance, and investment. This shows that you understand the value of putting in time and energy now for longer-term rewards, and have a strong desire to invest in sustainable results. See this as an invitation to step back from day-to-day operations and look at the bigger picture. Celebrate what you have created and assess your progress so fare. Are you on track? Similarly, if you are planning for the future, this encourages you tot take a long-term view and assess where you can best invest your time and energy for the maximum output. You do not want to keep putting your heart and soul into something if you won't reap the rewards for your work. Rest assured, your hard work will pay off. Sometimes, however, this can indicate frustration with slow results. You may have been working on something important, and may feel concerned that your efforts will go unrewarded. Remember to be patient and appreciate the progress you have made so far"
MinArcana[35].ArcanaMeaning = "apprenticeship, mastery, skill development, and repetitive tasks. This shows you may be working hard to improve your skills and become a master at what you do. You are diligent and hard-working, and are applying yourself fully to whatever is at the center of your attention. This may indicate further education or study in order to hone your skills. You may already be proficient in your particular skills, but are now seeking to master those skills. Know that you will not learn these advancedskills overnight, but you are prepared for the journey towards becoming an expert at your chosen expertise. This can also be a positive sign that you are committed to making changes to continuously improve the finer details of the various aspects of your life. See this as encouragement to keep doing what you are doing, as it will eventually lead to success"
MinArcana[36].ArcanaMeaning = "abundance, luxury, and self-sufficiency. Do not be scared to splurge, indulge, or pamper yourself as a reward for all of your hard work. While you may not be at the end of your goal just yet, this is your opportunity to acknowledge your achievements and re-energize yourself for the final phase of your goal. While this typically focuses on material wealth and gain, this can also suggest that you are in harmony with the environment around you"
MinArcana[37].ArcanaMeaning = "wealth, financial security, contribution, and family. See this as a positive sign that you have reached a point of completion and accomplishment in your journey.

This shows that you are surrounded by wealth and blessed with financial abundance. This can reflect permanence and creating a lasting foundation for future success. This can also indicate that you feel compelled to share your success with others to make sure they are well cared for, too. You worked hard to get here, and now you can see the bigger impact your accomplishments have on others, and it brings you deep joy and satisfaction to see your loved ones enjoying your wealth and abundance.

MinArcana[38].ArcanaMeaning = "manifestation, financial opportunity, and skill development. You may be tapping into your ability to manifest a personal goal or dream, and may be in the midst of a new project. This could be a hobby, business venture, or even the start of a new educational experience. You could be excited about the possibilities and potential of what you put your mind to, knowing you can create whatever you want with focused intention and action. That being said, this does not specify the fulfilment of dreams, as much as the initial motivation to begin the process of turning those dreams into a reality. Be sure to put in place clear plans for achieving your dreams and your goals. This often appears when you are ready to learn somehting new so that you can manifest these dreams. See this as an invitation to take a class or continue your education in this.

You have a plan in place, and are sticking to your schedule to get the job done. This asks you to continue what you are doing, as making gradual progress will surely see you achieving your goals. This can show that you are a natural planner and implementer. As you may be meticulous in your approach, you make sure that everything is planned and executed down to the tiniest detail. Sometimes, this can point to the more mundane aspects of life - such as repetitive schedules, household chores, or even just your daily grind. With this, you may be required to accept responsibility without any complaints or grudges"
MinArcana[40].ArcanaMeaning = "practicality, nurturing, and providing financially. You are embodying the ultimate working parent archetype. You care for your family and domestic responsibilities, while also making a living for yourself and creating financial abundance. Similarly, this can suggest that it is important to you to live independently, with a stable income and with enough time and space to nurture your loved ones. You may be trying to strike a better balance between your home and work lives, giving your all in both domains. This will ask you to maintain a compassionate, nurturing, practical, and down-to-earth attitude when dealing with others and your present circumstances. Focus on creating a calm and balanced life for yourself. Be resourceful and practical, dealing with issues as they arise using straightforward solutions that fix the problem with minimal fuss"
MinArcana[41].ArcanaMeaning = "wealth, leadership, security, and discipline. This shows you are confident and successful at attracting and managing wealth. Not only do you identify opportunities for growth and success, but you also draw upon your self-discipline and control to manage your wealth and invest it wisely for the long-term.

You have achieved great things and can finally say that you have completed your task or attained your goal.

If you feel a strong pull towards a new project or path, but are questioning whether it will work, this should give you a gentle nudge to pursue your passion. If you have been looking for a sign about whether this is the right project, take this as a clear yes. Even if you prefer to plan everything out before you begin down a particular path, this wants you to listen to your instincts and follow your gut. If it seems like a good idea, then it probably is. Keep in mind, however, that this represents potential, but not guaranteed results. The opportunity on offer shows great promise, but it will be up to you to maximize it for the long term"
MinArcana[43].ArcanaMeaning = "future planning, progress, decisions, and discovery.

With careful planning and a moderated approach, you will set yourself up for success"
MinArcana[44].ArcanaMeaning = "progress, expansion, and foresight. This signals the many chances available to you to broaden your horizons through study, travel, business enterprise, and learning. To take advantage of this potential, you must stay committed to your path and be prepared to stretch beyond your comfort zone, knowing your best hopes lie outside of your current environment. This should also bring your attention to the changes and challenges that lie ahead. You are likely to be already aware of the upcoming developments and obstacles in your way, and can prepare for them ahead of time"
MinArcana[45].ArcanaMeaning = "celebration, joy, harmony, and relaxation. This shows that you are returning home or to the people and places faliliar to you. You can feel supported and secure knowing you are with those who love you and care about you. This associates very closely with the home environment.

Everyone is fighting to be heard, but no one is listening. If you find yourself in this situation, see it as an opportunity to rise above the chaos and disorder. Take a moment to listen to what others have to say, even if you disagree. Sometimes, this type of conflict and discussion can be very productive, such as with group brainstorming and problem-solving. You need a constructive environment where you can test your ideas and have them challenged and improved by others.

MinArcana[48].ArcanaMeaning = "challenge, competitiion, and protection. After your previous successes, you are now in an enviable position and are being challenged by others who may want to take your place. It is a sad fact of life, but the more visibility you have as a leader in your field, and the bigger your audience, the more likely it is that you will need to grapple with this kind of pleasure. Expect to see a rise in people who disagree with you, as you will need to secure your territory and fight for what you stand for.

This is a sign that you are in connection with your subconscious mind and attuned to your intuition. You are exploring this part of yourself privately right now, and discovering how you can bring more intuition and flow into your life. On the flip side, this may be a sign that you are repressing your emotions, not wanting to express yourself fully to the outside world. You may feel embarrassed or afraid of what might happen if you were to express your emotions. You may worry that if you allow your feelings to flow, they might turn into an overwhelming flood that can't be switched off; however, be careful that you do not create an internal blockage by repressing how you feel"
MinReversed[1].ArcanaMeaning = "self-love, break-ups, disharmony, and distrust. Love, in any form, starts with love for yourself. If you don't love yourself, you'll end up projecting that lack onto others, becoming clingy and attached, attracting the wrong kinds of relationships to you, or worse, ending up in harmful situations. This can sometimes signal a break-up or a falling out. You are out of sync with someone, and don't share the same emotional conection you did in the past. To turn this situation around, open up, share, and hold a safe space for one another to express your feelings"
MinReversed[2].ArcanaMeaning = "independence, alone time, and the idea that three is a crowd. This may be your signal to work independently, rather than in a group with others for the time being.

If you are experiencing high levels of stress, take this as a message to take some time off to recuperate and gain the support of friends before returning to reality. See this as a reminder to reconnect with the people you care about, let loose and have a good time, without worrying too much about the consequences"
MinReversed[3].ArcanaMeaning = "retreat, withdrawal, and checking in for alignment. This reflects a period of introspection and withdrawal. You are retreating into your own inner world so you can concentrate on what is integral to you and what grounds you.

This may also suggest that you feel uninspired, disillusioned, or disappointed with the world around you You may avoid the challenges of the external world hoping that if you step out, the problems will go away, but let's be real: they will need your attention evbentually"
MinReversed[4].ArcanaMeaning = "personal setbacks, self-forgiveness, and moving on. You may worry that you're a failure and don't want to let others know you've taken the wrong path.

MinReversed[5].ArcanaMeaning = "living in the past, forgiveness, and lacking playfulness. Ask yourself whether you're clinging to the past and losing touch with the present. It's OK to reminisce about the past, as long as you understand that true and lasting change can only happen in the present moment. See this as an opportunity to make peace with the past so you can focus on the now. This may also be a sign that you have lost touch with your inner child and life has become boring, repetitive, and stale.

Open yourself to a curious mind and to have fun as though you were a child again"
MinReversed[6].ArcanaMeaning = "alignment, personal values, and feeling overwhelmed by choices. This often appears when you face several different choices and, instead of choosing the option that may appeal to others, you are relying on your inner wisdom and guidance to show you the best way.

MinReversed[8].ArcanaMeaning = "inner happiness, materialism, dissatisfaction, and indulgence. This is a sign that instead of looking outside yourself for your happiness, you should search within. Success and happiness mean different things to different people. Instead of doing what you think will make other people happy, do what will make you happy. Sometimes this suggests that you are frustrated that your wishes have not yet come true. Your expectations may be unrealistic, or you may not be actively puruing your dreams, hoping that htey will manifest with little input or action from you. This serves as a reminder to not over-indulge at the expense of your health and well-being. You may be prone to overdoing it on food, alcohol, drugs, partying, or spending.

This can reveal a misalignment of personal values. You are not living by your own values, nor are you being true to yourself. Instead, you are allowing others to decide what will and will not make you happy when you know you should determine that for yourself"
MinReversed[10].ArcanaMeaning = "new ideas, doubting intuition, creative blocks, and emotional immaturity. This can suggest that you are keeping your creative inspirations and ideas secret. You may worry that others will steal your idea or tell you it's destined to fail. With this, you may feel called to pursue a new creative project, but you doubt whether you can really make it work. Listen to your intuition to understand if fear is getting in the way and whether it's time to just give it a go regardless of the outcome. It is possible that you may experience a creative block. There is an aspect of yourself that wants to be expressed, but for whatever reason, you are holding back. If you are exploring your intuition, this can suggest that you are encountering a lot of doubt. Open yourself to your intuition and see where it takes you"
MinReversed[11].ArcanaMeaning = "overactive imagination, jealousy, and moodiness. When this appears, a creative project is emerging, but you are not ready to act on it just yet.

This can describe someone who has an overly romantic approach to life and is disconnected from reality. You may experience a level of disillusionment that an offer si not quite what you expected it to be because you have found yourself caught up in the excitement or emotion of a situation"
MinReversed[12].ArcanaMeaning = "inner feelings, self-care, self-love, and codependency. You need to draw your attention inwards and focus on your emotional well-being. You're great at taking care of others, but now it's time to take care of You. You may need to set firm boundaries with your loved ones so that they know you love them, but will not take on their emotional baggage. This could mean you are wrapped up in other peoples' emotional responses and have created a codependent relationship that is not healthy for either party. You may be gibing too much of yourself away, receiving little in return. This is often a sign that your intuition is on overdrive right now, but to hear it, you need to give yourself the time and the space to listen. It doesn't matter how busy you think you are - see this as your sign to reconnect with your intuition and tune in to your inner voice. This can also suggest that you may be out of touch with your emotions or forced to restrict or hold them down deep inside. This invites you to explore your innermost feelings and emotions to understand what makes you tick"
MinReversed[13].ArcanaMeaning = "self-compassion, inner feelings, and being emotionally manipulative. You may be prone to emotional upset and drama. Others may push your buttons, even to where you worry you might lose it and throw an emotional tantrum. This could show that you are repressing your emotions and withdrawing from the outside world because you fear what may happen if you were to confront your feelings head-on. Your feelings are bottling up inside you, and you are at risk of an emotional outburst if the pressure gets too much. At worst, this can represent someone who is vindictive and has a talent for being able to punish others through emotional manipulation. If this resonates for someone you have met in the past, you still have work to do in releasing yourself from his controlling forces"

MinReversed[14].ArcanaMeaning = "inner clarity, rethinking an idea, and clouded judgement. This indicates that a new idea or breakthrough is emerging from within you, but you are not willing to share it with others just yet. It's important to give yourself time and space to meditate and clear your mind so you can \"birth\" this idea in the most effective way. Sometimes, this can be a signal you have an idea that's not coming to fruition in the way you have hoped, and it's time to go back to the drawing board. You may still be pursuing an idea that no longer has any meaning to you, or you may have too many ideas on the go, and cannot commit to one course of action. This invites you to spend more time on defining in plain terms what it is you want in life. This can also suggest clouded judgement and lack of mental clarity around a specific situation. YOu are missing relevant information or evidence that will help you decide, so invest your time and energy into seeking out the truth rather than just taking things at face value"
MinReversed[15].ArcanaMeaning = "indecision, confusion, information overload, and stalemates. This suggests that you are facing a difficult decision and cannot decide which direction to take. You are caught between a rock and a hard place, and it feels impossible to make the \"right\" decision. You may also lack the information you need to make a sound decision, or you might be experiencing information overload, overwhelmed by others' points of veiw and a deluge of information. Sift through the advice available to select only the most relevant and helpful pieces. This is inviting you to listen to your intuition about this difficult decision. YOu may need to cut off from the external world temporarily so you can hear your inner voice and allow your wisdom to come through. Trust what you know to be true and right for you. This often represents a stalemate. You may reach an impasse with a friend, loved one, colleage, or otherwise. The trouble is that all parties involved are refusing to see the situation from the others' perspective and you are butting heads. Remove the blinders and look at the situation from a different angle, and identify where you can come to a compromise. Otherwise, this issue will not move forward"
MinReversed[16].ArcanaMeaning = "optimism, forgiveness, releasing pain, and negative self-talk. This encourages you to pay attention to your inner thoughts and self-talk. Your words are powerful, especially those you repeat to yourself day after day. You may be prone to self-criticism, limiting beliefs, and negative self-talk. When you hear these negative thoughts come up, ask yourself whether you would ever utter these words to a friend or loved one, and if the answer is a no, ask yourself why you are speaking these words to yourself. Look at how you can shift your thoughts towards the positive to reinforce your confidence. You have what it takes to be the person you deserve to be. This can indicate that you have recently gone through a difficult patch in which a relationship has been ended or challenged, a loved one has passed, or you were hurt by a situation that affected you deeply. Thankfully, this suggests that this time has passed, and you are on the road to recovery, realizing that with every cloud comes a silver lining, and that you have other things in your life which bring you joy. You have reached the point where you can accept the pain and are ready to move forward"
MinReversed[17].ArcanaMeaning = "exhaustion, burnout, deep contemplation, and stagnation. This sends a powerful message that you need to take time out to rest and recharge your energy. You may be working long hours, giving your time and energy to others in need, or involved in a highly stressful and demanding undertaking. If you do not stop and take some much-needed rest now, you may crash and burn out completely, rendering yourself completely ineffective and unable to help anyone. This can show that you are restless and wanting to do everything at once. Even if your body is telling you that you need to rest and relax, your mind may push you forward, trying to carry out a long list of tasks and making you sick or stressed as a result. So it is vital that you force yourself to take it easy to make sure you do not run yourself into the ground. This can also represent stagnation and a lack of action leading to increased frustration. You may need to take a break from something, and come back to it when the energy is flowing better. Similarly, this suggests that you are frustrated with the lack of progress and change in your life. Part of this lack of change may be due to your passive approach. There may have been situations that were frustrating to you or that you were unhappy with, but you chose to wait it out and hoped that they would eventually change, and you are now feeling the ramifications of that choice"
MinReversed[18].ArcanaMeaning = "reconciliation, making amends, and past resentment. This speaks for those times when you've tried to argue to the end, only to realize that you'll lose no matter what. You've been pushing and pushing, but whoever is on the other end is not listening, and no doubt they feel the same way. You're both fighting to win, at the expense of the other person. This shows that you want this period of fighting to be over so you can forgive and forget, and then try to focus on restoring the relationship back to normal. You realize that there can only be losers in this battle, and you want to move on. At times, this can express conflict in your life that you have tried to walk away from, but which continues to follow you. So long as conflict, tension, and raw emotion are at play, avoid this person or situation. Similarly, this can suggest that an old wound has reopened, and that you are experiencing the fear and tension associated with that memory.

MinReversed[19].ArcanaMeaning = "personal transition, resistance to change, and unfinished business. You may be going through a personal or spiritual transition or rite of passage so you can leave behind a relationship, belief, or behavioral pattern that is no longer serving you. At times, this indicates that you know you need to make a change or transition in your life, but are reluctant to do so. You may hope that the issue will go away on its own and you won't need to wrangle with this difficult decision, or you may try to fool yourself into thinking you can put up with it, even when you know deep in your heart it is time to move on. It is natural to want to avoid discomfort, but sometimes you must push beyond your comfort zone so you can evolve as a person. In some cases, this suggests that you are resisting change and transition because you believe that it has been forced upon you or you were not included in the decision. Where can you look forward to something and get personal value out of it? Reaffirm to yourself why you need to make this transition, and how it aligns with your own values. If you are trying to move on from the past but struggle to do so, this suggests that there may be unfinished business, unresolved conflict, or lessons which you need to understand before you can wholeheartedly move forward in your life.

Know that this is fear talking. You should work towards getting out of your own head, and trust that you have everything you need to make your new venture a success. Similarly, this can suggest that you are deceiving yourself, trying to trick yourself into believing something even though it is out of integrity with your true self. You may attempt to fool yourself that everything is okay when it's not. This can also represent keeping secrets hidden from others. You may be harboring a dark secret that you hope will never be revealed. Keeping this secret may bring you stress and tension, along with deeper feelings of guilt and shame. While the thought of confessing may be horrifying, it will free you from the negative emotions you are experiencing. First forgive yourself, then confide in someone you trust. You will no doubt feel much lighter as a result"

This suggests that limiting self-beliefs plague you, preventing you from moving forward. You may tell yourself that you do not deserve for things to happen to you, even being reluctant to accept those things when the opportunity arises. The beliefs you hold about yourself are preventing you from achieving your personal goals. In light of this, change your belief system. Catch yourself when you are in a negative thought pattern and break the cycle.. This also suggests that you are more prone to negative self-talk and suffering at the hands of your inner critic. You feel traped because every time you try to do something, your inner critic tells you why it's wrong or not good enough, so you give up trying altogether. This is a signal that skeletons in the closet need clearing out. On a positive note, this can show that you are releasing yourself from negative patterns and belief systems. You can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and you can create a more positive reality for yourself by letting go of those self-limiting beliefs. Acknowledge the options in front of you and refuse to play the role of the victim, taking greater accountability for where you are in life"
MinReversed[22].ArcanaMeaning = "inner turmoil, deep-seated fears, secrets, and releasing worry. This shows that you are experiencing deep inner turmoil as a result of your mindset. Your negative thoughts are taking you in a downward spiral of despair and anxiety that contradicts reality, and you are making things feel much worse than they really are.

Others will offer you a new perspective, or even just a place to vent, that will ease some of the stress and tension. This appears when you are gripped by fear. You are allowing your fears to impede your fullest potential and it is stripping you of your life force. You cannot take a step forward because you are so distressed about what might happen. Get a reality check and evaluate which fears are warranted, and which are not. This can also point out that you are incredibly hard on yourself, putting yourself down or engaging in negative self-talk. Ask yourself why you are so hard on yourself. What can you do to make yourself feel better? You may need to make a more conscious effort to quit the negative self-talk and replace it with positive reinforcement for a job well-done"
MinReversed[23].ArcanaMeaning = "recovery, regeneration, and resisting an inevitable end. This indicates you are combating an inevitable change because you are not ready to face up to what is happening; however, the more you resist, the more this situation will continue to drag on, so it's time to rip off the bandage (however painful that may be) and get this over with, so you can start fresh. Similarly, this may represent an old situation that ended badly. You are still carrying around wounds from it, but have buried them so deeply that you do not realize that they are still present. These old pains need to be dealt with once and for all. It may be difficult to delve back in, but it's the only way to release yourself of this pain and allow it to pass from your life. This encourages you to re-evaluate your circumstances and let go of any aspect of your life that is no longer serving you.

You prefer to express your thoughts and opinions privately or anonymously. If you need a little nudge to go public with your ideas and opinions, this might be it. At times, this can mean that you are all talk and no action. Be careful about making promises you know you can't keep, or saying things you'll later regret. Before making a specific promise or commitment, make sure you can and will deliver on it to preserve your integrity and reputation. This can also suggest you are acting hastily, without thinking things through. You have a lot of energy behind you but are not using it effectively. Tackle things one at a time, rather than trying to manage everything at once. Doing so will lead to more meaningful outcomes. This can also be a sign you are annoying others by your constant questioning and challenging of ideas. While you may just be trying to understand a concept better, there are more constructive and non-threatening ways to go about it. Be conscious of how you may come across to others and only challenge or question those ideas that are important to you"
MinReversed[25].ArcanaMeaning = "restlessness, impulsiveness, and being unfocused. This can appear when you are brimming with energy and motivation, but cannot effectively channel and release this energy.

Your thoughts are scattered, and you are constantly changing your mind. You may need to apply a single focus. Pick an idea and then stick with it until it is complete. It will take mental discipline to see it through. Are you up to the task?\nThis can also suggest that you need to slow down. Otherwise, you are at risk of severe burnout and exhaustion. You want to be involved in everything, but you are not succeeding at anything due to this roving energy. As such, you are accomplishing very little and growing more tired by the day. Take some time out so that you can first ground yourself, gather your thoughts and concentrate on only the top priorities. Finally, this can indicate that you need to go it alone to build up valuable life experience and maturity. As you search for freedom and independence, it is likely you will make mistakes on your way due to your reckless and impatient nature, but this is all a part of the journey"
MinReversed[26].ArcanaMeaning = "being overly emotional, easily influenced, and cold-hearted. This points out that you may allow your emotions to get the better of you as you put your heart before your head. You need to use your head a bit more to understand what is happening and read the signals more accurately.

You are allowing others to dominate and negatively affect yoru ability to make decisions.l You hesitate to pursue your plans because you don't want to rock the boat or disrupt your relationships with others. At the end of the day, however, you need to be more confident and assertive to be successful.\nAt times, this can come across as cold-hearted and resentful.

You may be putting others off-side and losing your supporter base, isolating yourself from others and being seen as narrow-minded, intolerant, and mean"
MinReversed[27].ArcanaMeaning = "Quiet power, inner truth, misuse of power, and manipulation. Sometimes, this can allude to a misuse of power. You may have accumulated significant power and authority, but it has gone to your head, and your ego is now running the show. You may be using your ability to manipulate or persuade others to fulfil your personal needs. This can represent someone who is very intelligent, and likes to show off to others about how smart they are by using big words or discussing lofty topics about which no one else knows. This may represent a person in your life, or even yourself; either way, you need to be wary, because although this person may be intelligent, they can only do harm. They only have their personal interests in mind, and will do whatever they can to achieve these interests.\nThis can also reflect a lack of decisiveness about where your best opportunities lie, or in what direction you want to go. You may also lack the mental clarity to work out what you need to do in your situation. As a result, you are delaying necessary decisions and generally not achieving anything because you are getting so worried"

As the saying goes, \"Don't count your chickens before they hatch\". Furthermore, this advises you to be very careful with your expenditures. Now is not the time to get in over your head or take on any oblictions with huge monthly repayments. Do not rely on the promise of a financial opportunity in the future.

Others may not see it yet, but the stress is getting to you, and you may even catch yourself droping the ball. You may need to bring more structure to your responsibilities and turn down opportunities that are no longer in alignment with your goals. This can also be a sign you are over-investing in one area of your life at the expense of others. For example, you may excel in your career, but you have little time for your family, leaving them feeling disconnected and alone. Something has to give.\nThis invites you to reassess your priorities and goals and decide where you want to spend your time and energy. Distractions are plenty, and it will take every ounce of your concentration to stay true to your goals.

You need to realign with the original goals of the project and make new agreements about how you will work together to achieve those goals. This can suggest that you need to bring more systematic energy into this.\nThere may also be a lack of respect between team members, with individuals trying to prove themselves and gain superiority over others. If this is the case, set clear guidelines for the team, especially around respect and collaboration. Acknowledge the unique contribution each person makes, no matter their experience or knowledge.\nThis can also point out that you are working in a job in which your contributions and experience go unappreciated and under-valued. There is not much opportunity for growth and advancement, and you feel as if your skills and capabilities are not being utilized.

As a result, you may be loosening your grip on the need to surround yourself with these things, in favor of seeking out more love and happiness in your life instead.\nThis can also indicate that money is slipping through your fingers and your spending habits are exceeding your saving habits. You may be spending unconsciously, hoping that it will bring happiness, but all it does is bring you more stress and anxiety as your bank balance declines.\nAt times, this can suggest that your love for money has turned to greed. You want more, but at what cost? In this quest, you may be working longer hours, but neglecting your loved ones. Look at the overall equation of cost vs benefit, and assess whether your quest for more is really bringing you the happiness that you desire.\nFinally, this can appear when you are in self-protection mode. You have a strong desire for security, stability, and certainty, and you are doing everything in your power to create a stable environment for yourself. Even when your outer world seems chaotic and in a state of constant change, you can create more certainty for yourself by controlling your inner environment"
MinReversed[32].ArcanaMeaning = "recovery from financial loss and spiritual poverty.

You may have a tendency to spend or give away more than you can afford.\nThis asks you to be mindful about taking on debt. You are prone to getting in over your head, and it may come back to bite you with increasing interest rates or personal threats if you are unable to pay it back in time.\nThis can sometimes reflect the selfish side of charity.

MinReversed[34].ArcanaMeaning = "lack of long-term vision and limited success or reward.

Some people are inclined to keep \"toughing it out\", just because they spend time, energy, or money and don't want to admit defeat; however, you are adept at identifying when a situation is no longer delivering you any value and know when to pack it in and try something else"

When you live a luxurious lifestyle, you may want more and more, never feeling satisfied with what you have.You may find that you burn thorugh your financial reserves as you desperately try to support this higher standard of living, and are unwilling to downgrade, even if your cashflow diminishes.

It is time to re-evaluate your position and choose a course of action that will help you regain your sense of security and self-worth"
MinReversed[38].ArcanaMeaning = "lack of progress, procrastination, and learning from failure. This says you are exploring a new project or business idea, but are not ready to move forward with it just yet. You may worry that you do not have the skills or resources for it to succeed, so you are puting the idea on hold or procrastinating. If the opportunity continues to present itself to you, trust that you have what you need now, and the rest will develop as you progress.\nThis can suggest that you are trying to get a specific project or idea off the ground, but each time you try, it seems to amount to nothing or takes you even further away from where you want to be. Give yourself some space and step away from the project for a short period so you can refocus and re-energize before trying again.\nFinally, this invites you to learn from your past mistakes. Even if a situation has not worked out the way you expected it would, you can discover new aspects of yourself that might help in the future.

Instead of trying new things or dreaming up more ideas, this encourages you to establish a schedule or routine for yourself and stick to it until you have completed your assigned task.\nThis can also point to a journey of self development or improvement, in which a routine will support your success. Mundane activities such as home upkeep, money matters, business relationships, and moving forward in your career have been left by the wayside as you focus on more exciting or important opportunities. Depending on what is on your plate, you may want to make more time to get your life in order, or you may continue to focus on more pressing priorities.\nOn the flipside, this might also suggest that you are feeling stuck in the daily grind and life has become boring and dull. While you may have implemented a routine and schedule to increase your productivity and efficiency, you are now finding it stifling to your creativity and innovation. It may be time to do something different. Be spontaneous. You don't always have to stick to the rules.\nThis can also warn that you are becoming a perfectionist in how you approach your work.

You may do anyting for an extra buck, even if it means selling your soul and your integrity. If this resonates, step back for a moment and look at the greater impact of your obsession with money. Is it serving you in this state, or do you need to change?\nAt times, this represents someone who is very stubborn and rigid in their approach. When this shows up, look at your life. Are you feeling stuck in a rut? Has life become so predictable and routine that it is completely dull and lifeless? Being grounded is a good thing, but give yourself permission every now and then to break free and do something different"

This lack of direction may sap your energy and leave you unmotivated and uninspired. As a result, you are often asking yourself if this is what you want in life and whether there might be something better elsewhere; however, when you think about what other opportunities might appeal, you struggle to know what you want. To remedy this stagnation, you need to first focus on where your true passions lie. There is no point in working towards a goal if it does not motivate you.\nThis may be a sign that frustrating delays are impeding the progress of yoru projects and ideas. You are likely to feel very impatient, especially if you are action-oriented and have only just started to gain momentum in your activities. The key message here is \"Not now, but maybe later\".

This invites you to go back to the drawing board and reconnect with your dreams and ambitions, then make the necessary adjustments to your clear path ahead.\nAt times, this can indicate that you have a fruitful idea, but lack a clear strategy to move it forward. As a result, you are working haphazardly and inefficiently, and not reaching your desired destination as quickly as you would like. Go back to your original intention, and the energy and enthusiasm you felt at the beginning, and let them guide you to the next step.\nSimilarly, this can highlight that you are reluctant to step out into unknown territories despite the enormous potential, instead preferring to stick with what you know. You may enjoy the feeling of success in this safe environment.

Unexpected delays and creative blockages might have popped up on your path. There is disappointment, frustration, and a general feeling that you may have just wasted your time by even starting on this path. What you might not realize, however, is that these setvacks are an essential part of your life's journey and contribute to your personal evolution.\nSimilarly, this can indicate that your plans might come to a grinding halt with unexpected delays and other frustrating obstacles. You may need to wait on others to complete a task, or you have underestimated how much time the work involves. Be sure to add buffer time when planning these things, so external problems don't adversely affect you.\nYou may also struggle to put your plans into action, and are now feeling worried that you have overcommitted yourself.

You do not feel compelled to proclaim this achievement to others, instead choosing to create your own special reward for the hard work you put in. you may also be in the midst of your journey and yet to reach the finish line, hence why you prefer to honor this mini milestone privately.\nThis can also mean that you have achieved a level of inner harmony and stability. If you have doubted yourself in the past, or struggled with self-acceptance or empathy, the appearance of this card is a welcome sign that you have found a sense of greater balance within yourself.\nThis also may point to a lack of harmony or a breakdown in communication in your family or household. Tension might be rumbling between family members or loved ones, and you keep finding yourself getting caught up in other peoples' concerns and relationship problems. This may leave you uncertain about your relationships and what (or whom) you can and cannot depend on.\nThis can suggest that you are going through an upheaval during which you have little stability and security. You may experience multiple changes in your life, such as changing your job, moving to a new house, or leaving a relationship.

MinReversed[46].ArcanaMeaning = "inner conflict, conflict avoidance, and tension release. This suggests that you are facing internal conflicts and are unclear on where you stand on important issues. You may try to work through your point of view on contentious topics, or you may navigate personal issues. You have others around you who have strong views about what you should do, and this is creating an enormous amount of tension and disagreement. Just when you think you have a clear perspective, someone challenges you on it or you discover new information, and you have to change your viewpoint again. This process is beneficial and will help you come to a well-researched and well-thought-out viewpoint.\nThis can suggest that you have the tendency to avoid conflict wherever feasible. You may find that any tension makes you feel uneasy, and you wish it would go away, so you deflect a lot of that energy and ignore the problem, if there is one. The trouble is that in doing this, you may just be pushing some onf your concerns to the side, without dealing with them or asserting your point of view. Some conflict can be useful, particularly if it is constructive and draws out the underlying issues in a way that then generates a better solution"
MinReversed[47].ArcanaMeaning = "private achievement, fall from grace, egotism, and your personal definition of success. This suggests that you have reached a significant personal milestone, but you prefer to keep it to yourself right now. You may be uncomfortable receiving public praise for your work, or it may be such a private achievement that you have no reason to share it with others. Just try to ask yourself: are you avoiding sharing it because you lack confidence or you feel nervous about being too over-the-top?\nThis encourages you to create your own definition of success. If you have found yourself seeking approval and validation or comparing yourself to others, you may have stripped yourself of your personal power and self-belief. Rather than relying on someone else's definition of what is successful and what is not, try to bring your attention within and ask yourself what success means to you. Your answer will look different from other peoples' interpretations, because your values and priorities are unique to you.\nAt times, this may suggest that you had a fall from grace and did not receive the public recognition you were seeking.

MinReversed[48].ArcanaMeaning = "exhaustion, giving up, and feeling overwhelmed. This shows that external pressure is weighing you down, leaving you doubting yourself and whether everything is worth it. It may seem as if you are under constant opposition. Don't let this get to you. Even if you are weary, this urges you to keep fighting for what you believe in. Stand strong and don't change who you are just to keep others happy.\nThis can also mean you think others are perpetually criticizing you. Your family or friends are questioning your choices, such as staying at an unfulfilling job, and you would prefer if they could just keep their mouths shut and leave you be.\nThis serves as a reminder that you will not always win everyone over. There will still be challenges and opposition to your point of view, and you cannot keep everyone happy all the time. Thus, it is time to draw your line in the sand and say \"This is who I am, and this is what I need right now\". There cannot be any compromise or negotiation at this stage.\nThis may affirm that you are overwhelmed by the challenges and responsibilities in your life, finding yourself quickly snowed under and unable to look at the bigger picture. You may have taken on too many commitments and now want to focus your attention on only one or two things. You may also worry that you must compete against others, leaving you feeling somewhat inadequate and vulnerable. Be sure to rebuild your self-esteem and confidence, and have faith that you can achieve what you set out to do.\nFinally, this can appear when you are trying to avoid conflict wherever possible and, as a result, you are backing down from your point of view too easily. As soon as someone challenges you, you give in or compromise, instead of standing up for yourself. Is being accepted and liked by others more important than fighting for what you believe in? Alternatively, you may have tried and given it your best shot, but you now see it is not worth the struggle. Even though you might not have made any progress yet, it is time to let this one go and move on"
MinReversed[49].ArcanaMeaning = "delays, frustration, and resisting change. This suggests that you are charging ahead with an idea or plan, but you need to slow down and consider your next steps before continuing. You may miss something in your hast and be prone to making mistakes or poor decisions. Be careful of the Bright Shiny Object syndrome, where, just as you get started on implementing one idea, another comes to mind, and you switch your focus. The trouble is that with this approach, you never accomplish anything because you are jumping from one idea to the next and finishing none of them.\nThis can warn that you are resisting change, trying to stop the flow of energy and movement. This will only make things harder, so let go and be in the flow.\nThis can mark significant delays, particularly concerning fast-moving plans. Despite having a lot of energy and enthusiasm to progress things forward, you now face multiple obstacles in your course. This is incredibly frustrating, and you may be growing increasingly impatient by the day. Keep looking for alternative ways around the challenges presented so you can carry out your plans.\nOn the other hand, this may be a sign that you are aligning your resources so you can actively pursue your goal. You are getting your life in order, so that you are in an excellent position to move forward with your plans"
MinReversed[50].ArcanaMeaning = "inner resources, struggle, paranoia, and being defensive. This suggests that you are struggling to keep working towards your goal. The challenges on your path are relentless, pummelling you with setback after setback. You don't know if you can cope with it anymore and may be ready to give up. Just know that you are close to completing this challenge. Draw upon your resilience and courage to keep you going. You have it in you to turn this challenge into a success.\nThis can also appear when you feel overcome by your responsibilities or lack the support of those around you. It seems as if life is all work and no play. Make sure you do not take on any other commitments at this stage until you have more control over your circumstances. If you cannot see any end in sight, try to reach out for help.\nSometimes, this can indicate paranoia, defensiveness, and concern that everyone is out to get you. Often, this is a sign of fear from within you, rather than an actual external threat. Try to focus on your own game and don't worry about what other people are saying or thinking about you"
MinReversed[51].ArcanaMeaning = "delegation, release, and carrying the burden. When this appears, it is often a sign that you are trying to do too much by yourself. In your effort to be everything to everyone, you have found yourself struggling under the weight of it all. Be sure to delegate and share the work, as you don't have to do it alone. It is imperitive that you put your self care and personal wellbeing first, otherwise you'll burn yourself out and be of no help to anyone.\nSimilarly, this suggests that you are carrying a heavy weight on your shoulders, but you are keeping this private and are unwilling to share your burden with others. You may be grappling with emotional trauma, carrying a dark secret, or dealing with increased responsibilities; however, you do not feel comfortable sharing this with others, by talking about it or asking for help. You may find it to be a huge relief when you do share some of this burden with others, as they are ready and willing to support you.\nSometimes, this shows that you are holding on to this burden when you do not need to do so. Try to check to see if you can delegate certain tasks or responsibilities to someone else. Do not become a martyr and take on more than you can realistically handle. On the positive side, this shows that this time will soon pass, and you will be able to set down this weight"
MinReversed[52].ArcanaMeaning = "newly-formed ideas, self-limiting beliefs, and redirecting energy. This suggests that you can feel the stirrings of something new emerging within you, but don't know how to turn it into action. You do not need to take action yet; in fact, doing so may be detrimental, since this idea is very much in its early stages of formation. For now, just play with this idea and let it grow, develop, and blossom into what it wants to be. Do not force it.\nOn the other hand, this can mean that you tried many new ventures or projects, but these have not turned out as you had hoped. You may have tried to start a new hobby or project with the idea that it would lead to something bigger, but you realize that you took the wrong approach and it isn't pointing to the growth and development you had expected. This invites you to reconnect with your original idea and look for alternative ways to express it. Just because you didn't succeed the first time, it doesn't mean that the concept is wrong; it may merely be the execution that was the issue.\nThis can indicate that your eagerness to start something new has been hampered by complexities, obstacles, and opposition, which has resulted in a lack of motivation and indecisiveness about your path forward. You may be allowing limiting beliefs and inner fears and anxieties to get in the way of achieving your dreams.\nFinally, this may also appear when you are seeking out a new path of personal discovery. As it is likely to be an intense path, you are choosing to keep this journey private. You know, too, that inspiration and understanding comes from within, rather than looking to others for the answers"
MinReversed[53].ArcanaMeaning = "haste, delays, frustration, and passion projects. This may appear when you are actively pursuing a passion project or hobby. A fire has been lit under you, and now you are doing everything in your power to move this project forward. You have no intention of turning it into a raging success, it is simply for you to enjoy and channel your energy into.\nThis can signal that you are experiencing a considerable build-up of energy, but are unsure about how to channel it into the world effectively. You may have a creative restlessness, knowing that you are destined for something big, but you are restricted from taking action right now. You may need to adjust your path somewhat while staying true to your original idea.\nConversely, this suggests that you may be acting impulsively, trying to accomplish everything at once. You are rushing from one task to another, without focusing on the details or ensuring sustainable success. This may appear to work in the short-term, but long-term you could end up burning yourself out or falling short of your goals. Slow down and know that you don't need to do everything at once.\nThis also suggests that you are at risk of acting impulsively, doing or saying things that you may later regret. You want everything to be fixed straight away, but you do not allow yourself the time to think through what is best for you. Be careful, too, that you are not reacting instantly to everything that happens. Give your circumstances some space and time before you take action. You may also find yourself feeling frustrated that factors beyond your control are impacting your situation. Again, just remind yourself that there will be things that you can control and change as you want, you just have to find them"
MinReversed[54].ArcanaMeaning = "self-respect, self-confidence, introversion, and a re-established sense of self. This shows that you know yourself on a deep level, and you are clear on your personal truth and belief systems. You know what you stand for, and you are not easily moved by the opinions of others. You have also defined what success means to you, even if it differs from others' definitions.\nThis can also suggest that you may be more introverted than usual. Instead of being the social butterfly, you prefer to linger on the sidelines and watch what is going on. This is perfectly okay. Honor your needs and feelings, and don't push yourself to be extroverted when you don't want to be.\nIf you're lacking in confidence, this invites you to bring your attention inward and focus on rebuilding your sense of self and your resilience. You may have handed your power over to others by paying too much attention to their thoughts and opinions. Now, you need to be able to hear yourself and access your personal strengths and talents. Discover who you are and be courageous in expressing yourself in everything you do, even if it is different from what others expect of you"
MinReversed[55].ArcanaMeaning = "impulsiveness, haste, ruthlessness, and high expectations. This suggests that while you are in a leadership position, you are not ready to step into that role. You may be the creative visionary in your work, but you have not yet developed a sense of comfort with leading others towards your vision. You may need to work on your leadership skills or enlist the support of someone who has a natural talent at steering others towards a common goal. Alternatively, you may manage others, but are not leading others. You are assigning tasks and monitoring performance, but you are not communicating the vision and engaging your team to take responsibility for bringing the concept to life.\nAt times, you can be aggressive and even arrogant in the pursuit of your goals. Be mindful that as you strive towards your dream, you are not putting others to the side, disempowering them, or taking their contributions for granted. You need their support one-hundred percent of the way. Also, don't let success go to your head. Consider embracing the concept of followership: the ability to take direction, be a part of a team, and deliver on what is expected of you, even as the official leader of a group.\nOn a personal level, this wards you against setting unrealistic expectations for yourself and others. While you are highly ambitious, you may be setting yourself up for failure if you set goals that are significantly out of reach and then pushing hard to reach those unattainable goals. you may also be prone to get swept up in the hype of other peoples' goals. You don't have to buy into other peoples' dreams and visions. Stay true to what's important to you, and keep focused on your personal vision and direction"
